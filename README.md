We also included a add button to where you can add more profile images of your recent traveled locations.  There's the image section where you can see all your updated pictures organized in 3 columns and 2 rows till you go down to about 895 width for tablet use it turns into a 2 column and 3 row website then when you get to mobile use at about 320px it turns to 1 single column. There is a description section for the image and to the side there is a like button which is a heart image which will chage color when hovered over.
